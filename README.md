# About
This project was launched in response to the City SDK Challenge from Code for America's Hack For Change initiative. Our goal is to develop an open source web application to allow for local leaders, agencies, and citizens to cross examine data from federal, state, county, and city sources with ease. For example, comparing the locations of farmer's markets with average household income, in order to illustrate potential food deserts in the Tucson metro area.

# Next Steps
Our next steps include:
- Define a concise set of user stories for our scope
- Further integrate our implementation of the City SDK into a native backend
- Explore additional local datasets to include in our offering
- Publish a public beta of our webapp
